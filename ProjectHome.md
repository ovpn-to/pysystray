pySystray is a light Python framework for building win32 applications that run from the System Tray.

Usually, these components are part of larger applications and are referred to as Notify Tray Icons. But I saw no reason why I couldn't write whole Python programs to just sit there.

pySystray is currently built as a very thin abstraction layer atop SysTrayIcon.py, which was built by Simon Brunnings. pySystray is released as OpenSource Software.
